| **Projects** | **Description** | **Notes** |
| -------------------- | :--------------------- |:---------------------------|
| AutoEncoders Pytorch|Working with autoencoders: Vanilla Autoencoder, Variation Autoencoder (VAE), Conditional VAE | Numpy, Pandas, Torch, TorchVision, Sklearn, Plotly, Tqdm, Scipy, Matplotlib, Catalyst |
| Determining the age of customers|Analyzing purchases and suggesting products that may interest customers in this age group. | Pandas, Tenserflow, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PIL|
|  kaggle_simpson| We need to help FOX to handle their content. The Simsons series has been on television for over 25 years, and during this time a lot of video material has accumulated. Characters have changed along with the changing graphics technologies and Homer 2018 is not very similar to Homer 1989. Our task will be to learn how to classify the characters living in Springfield. | Numpy, Pandas, Torch, TorchVision, Torchensemble, Sklearn, Plotly, Tqdm, Scipy, Matplotlib, Catalyst, PIL|
| pyTorch_baseline | Working with fully connected and convolutional neural networks.| Numpy, CV2, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Torch, TorchVision, Catalyst, Tqdm|
| pyTorch_GAN|The task is to train and test your own GAN. Train the GAN to generate human faces and explore methods for evaluating the quality of the generated images. | Numpy, Pandas, CV2, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Torch, TorchVision, Catalyst, Tqdm |
